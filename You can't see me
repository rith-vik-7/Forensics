CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Here, the png data was messed up. So, we can check this by **pngcheck** and correct the corresponding error with **ghex**.  

Firstly, If we look into the hex data, We can observe that magic numbers are not coorect. 

Then, We can correct the magic numbers and the first chunk from *IDHR* to *IHDR*.

Now, pngcheck shows an error with reserved-bit-set chunk *gama*. We need to correct it to *gAMA*.  

Now, pngcheck shows an error with reserved-bit-set chunk *idat*. We need to correct it to *IDAT*.  

Now, pngcheck shows an error with reserved-bit-set chunk *INED*. We need to correct it to *IEND*.  

Finaly pngcheck shows ```OK: 1.png (269x200, 24-bit RGB, non-interlaced, 72.8%).```  

Now, we will get our flag in the png.
