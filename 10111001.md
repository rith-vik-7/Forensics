Here the name of the file is given as steg and was said about significant digit. So, the task can be solved using **ZSTEG** since it is **PNG**.  

```zsteg steg.png ``` gives us a flag which was not in format.  

Recieved flag:  
```NFXGG5DGNJ5TI3K7ORUDGX2MGNAVG5C7GVUUO3RRMYYWGNDOKRPWEVKUL4YV6YZUJZPXI4RQOVBEYM27LEYHKXZUL5WDAVD5```

By decoding the recieved flag in [base32](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/base32_decode.html), We will get our flag:  
```inctfj{4m_th3_L3ASt_5iGn1f1c4nT_bUT_1_c4N_tr0uBL3_Y0u_4_l0T}```
